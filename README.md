# Trek
This was a single page application to pratice JavaScript, AJAX, and consuming an API.

## Trek
Trek is a web application that displays deals on travel packages. 

You will build a single page application that will query data from an api, using AJAX, to display a list or trips and view more information on a specific trip. While viewing a specific trip, you can claim your spot by sending data back to the API. 

All of this should be done without ever having to reload the page. Meaning, it will be a single page application and will only need one html page (index.html). 

Reminder: You shall use HTML best-practices. You should organize your HTML by grouping content using semantic HTML tags.

### The API

View the [Travel API's documentation](https://github.com/ada-c6/trip_api). 


### Minimum Requirements 
  - **Wave 1** Click button or link to show all trips
  - **Wave 2** Can click on a trip, from the list of trips, to see more information about that trip
    - Should be able to see id, name, destination, continent, about, category, weeks and cost 
  - **Wave 3** While viewing a single trip, you can reserve a spot
    - Use a form to submit your name to reserve a spot on the trip you are viewing


### Optional Enhancements
  - **For more practice with showing a list of Many Trips**, Show trips by search queries (like by continent, budget, etc.). Will need to explore API to see what functionality exists. 
  - **To practice a more advanced POST**, Setup the functionalit to create a new trip. 
  - **For more JQuery Practice**, Use Jquery to resort list of trips by specific attributes, like budget or time remaining. 
  - **For an extra challenge**, Have the number of spots available update on a page automatically if another user were to reserve a spot while you were viewing that trip.
